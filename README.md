# rainbow-loader-butterfly
Pride preloader made in the form of a rainbow butterfly

The preloader is made on css, but there is a scss-file in the folder too, so that you can easily connect it to your project.
You can watch the preloader, as well as try to change the size, background color or caption (the container with the caption can be removed if you wish) on <a href='https://codepen.io/MartaKhromova/pen/zYZjpxb'>Code Pen</a>
